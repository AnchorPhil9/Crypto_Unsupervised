# Crypto_Unsupervised
We have been tasked to create a report on cryptocurrencies being traded. For this project, we have obtained cryptocurrency data from CryptoCompare. Once we process all the data for currently traded cryptocurrencies, we will use unsupervised machine learning to group that data together and gain a better view of it.
